# Question 4 Analysis
## SumOrSameGame

This  section contains my analysis of Question 4 (2D Arrays):

#### My initial approach during the exam:

- use a for loop within for loop and use math.random from 1 to 9
  
#### My revised solution after review:

- create new puzzle and puzzle = (int) (Math.random () * 9) +1
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Math.random
- for loop rows
- for loop cols
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

- Math.random from a minium to maxium
- double for loop
