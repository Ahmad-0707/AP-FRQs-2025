# Question 4 Analysis
## SumOrSameGame

This  section contains my analysis of Question 4 (2D Arrays):

#### My initial approach during the exam:

- use a for loop within for loop and use math.random from 1 to 9
  
#### My revised solution after review:

- create new puzzle and puzzle = (int) (Math.random () * 9) +1 and adjust the range it randomizes (1 to 9).
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Math.random:Makes random numbers 1-9. Used to fill puzzle
- Nested Loops: Row loop: goes down.Column loop: goes across.Together: fills whole grid
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

- How to use double loops to fill a grid
- How to make random numbers in a range
