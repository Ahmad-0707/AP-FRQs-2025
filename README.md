# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions by Ahmadjon O.*

## Introduction 
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on May 7, 2025. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

#### Exam Experience 
I reflect on my experience taking the AP Computer Science exam, highlighting key moments, challenges, and lessons learned.

- My exam preparation strategy included completing all assignments posted by Mr. Hans, as well as any additional practice materials, such as textbook exercises for multiple-choice questions.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were the free-response questions (FRQs) that involved ArrayLists and arrays.
- Time management techniques helped me stay on track. I was able to monitor my pace and determine whether I needed to speed up or could afford to spend more time on certain questions.
- When facing tough questions, using my CSA knowledge to earn as many points as possible and keep a collected mindset.

#### Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Arrays: Fixed-size lists that store multiple values of the same type. You access elements using an index, and loops help modify or traverse them efficiently.
- ArrayLists: Resizable lists that allow dynamic storage. They have built-in methods for adding, removing, and searching elements without manually handling resizing.
- Practice using arrays and ArrayLists by writing programs that store and modify data. Try sorting and searching elements to strengthen your skills.

#### Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- AP College Board:https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/
- Knowt: https://knowt.com/exams/AP/AP-Computer-Science-A

#### Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
 - Continue to improve my coding skills by learning different types of coding languages such as C.
 - Use my knowledge on javascript to help get into interships and potentially an engineering job.
