# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions by Ahmadjon O.*

## Introduction 
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on [Date]. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience 
I reflect on my experience taking the AP Computer Science exam, highlighting key moments, challenges, and lessons learned.

  -My preparation strategy for the exam included completing all the assignments Mr. Hans posted and any other extra practices that were given such as the textbook for mcq practice.
  -The most challenging aspects of the exam were the FRQs that had to deal with arraylists and arrays.
  -Time management techniques that worked well for me because I was able to keep track and determine whether if I need to speed up or I can speed more time on the question.
  -Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions were to use my knowledge about CSA and try to get as many points as I can from the FRQs and remain collected.
