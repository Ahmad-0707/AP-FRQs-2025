# Question 3 Analysis

## Competition/Competitor

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Arrays and ArrayLists):

#### My initial approach during the exam:

- I knew I needed to make a new ArrayList and I would need a for loop to add the names into the list

#### My revised solution after review:

- Used competitorList.add() to put competitors in list. Each competitor gets a name and number

#### Key concepts tested in this question:

- Making ArrayList: new ArrayList<>();
- Using for loop to process names
- Using .add() to put things in list

#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

- How to create ArrayList
- How to add items to it
- How to process names one by one
