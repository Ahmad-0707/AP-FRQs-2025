# Question 3 Analysis

## Competition/Competitor

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Arrays and ArrayLists):

#### My initial approach during the exam:

- I knew I needed to make a new ArrayList and I would need a for loop to add the names into the list

#### My revised solution after review:

- use competitorList.add 

#### Key concepts tested in this question:

- Make a new ArrayList
- Use for loop and use .add in the for loop to add the names in the list

#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

- New ArrayList<>();
- .add in the ArrayList
