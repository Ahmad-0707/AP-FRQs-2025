# Question 3 Analysis

## Competition/Competitor

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Arrays and ArrayLists):

My initial approach during the exam:

I knew I needed to make a new ArrayList and I would need a for loop to add the names into the list

My revised solution after review:

use competitorList.add 

Key concepts tested in this question:

make a new ArrayList
use for loop and use .add in the for loop to add the names in the list

What I learned from revisiting this problem:

new ArrayList<>();
.add in the ArrayList
