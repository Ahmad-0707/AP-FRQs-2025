# Question 2 Analysis

## Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

#### My initial approach during the exam:

- Class name,instance variables,constructor,getSignature method and addSignature method.

#### My revised solution after review:

- Use indexOf. and substring to complete the addSignature method.

#### Key concepts tested in this question:

- Writing class:Contains variables (firstName, lastName),Has constructor to create objects, Has methods to do tasks (getSignature, addSignature)
- IndexOf:Finds where a signature appears in text. Like a search tool in your text
- Substring:Cuts pieces from text. Examples: getting first initial, removing old signature

#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

- Handling empty names correctly.
- Working with strings and text efficiently.
