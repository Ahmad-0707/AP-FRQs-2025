# Question 1 Analysis

## Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

My initial approach during the exam:

I knew I needed a if statment in my code and I also needed a variable that finds the amount of dogs from the company. I would also need to use a for loop for part B and a variable  for total pay

My revised solution after review:

I needed to use company. when calling those methods such as .numAvaibleDogs and .updateDogs.

Key concepts tested in this question:

Method calls
for loops
if statements 
variable

What I learned from revisiting this problem:

I learned I could use only one if statement that has ||(or) to make the coding easier.
