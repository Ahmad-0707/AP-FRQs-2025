# Question 1 Analysis

## Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:

- I knew I needed a if statment in my code and I also needed a variable that finds the amount of dogs from the company. I would also need to use a for loop for part B and a variable  for total pay

#### My revised solution after review:

- I needed to use company. when calling those methods such as .numAvaibleDogs and .updateDogs.

#### Key concepts tested in this question:

- Method calls: Using company.numAvailableDogs() and company.updateDogs() to interact with the company object
- For loops:
- If statements:if(maxDogs > numDogs) makes a simple decision: can you take all available dogs or just your maximum?
- Variables:hours, numDogs, and maxDogs store important values you need to track

#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

- I learned I could use only one if statement that has ||(or) to make the coding easier.
